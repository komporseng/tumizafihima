ordered by the Republican-controlled state Senate in Arizona and is being paid for with a combination of tax payer money and private donations.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>In a public meeting on Monday night and in a letter to&nbsp;state Senate President Karen Fann, who ordered the recount, the Maricopa county board criticized the audit as a ‘spectacle’ that is causing Arizona to be a ‘laughing stock’ and encouraging people to distrust elections.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>In their letter to Fann, the county board of supervisors called out ‘the big lie,’ referring to the false claim the election was stolen from Trump.

Our state has become a laughingstock. Worse, this ‘audit’ is encouraging our citizens to distrust elections, which weakens our democratic republic,’ they wrote.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Richer told CNN the officials sent the letter to Fann because they’re exhausted.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘It is exhausting having to respond to every insinuation when we’re trying to do the normal work of the county.
