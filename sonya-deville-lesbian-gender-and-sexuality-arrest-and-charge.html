She has competed in WWE under the ring name Sonya Deville and was a contestant on the WWE reality show Tough Enough in 2015.</p><p>Deville has been open about her identity and has used her platform to advocate for acceptance and inclusivity for LGBTQ+ individuals. Likewise, Deville recently made headlines after being arrested in March 2023.</p><h2>Is Sonya Deville Lesbian? Gender And Sexuality</h2><p>Deville has spoken publicly about her attraction to women and her identity as a lesbian. In an interview with ESPN in 2018, she discussed coming out to her family and friends and the impact it had on her life.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/tvshowstars.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Sonya-Deville-1.jpg><p>She has also used her platform to promote acceptance and inclusivity for LGBTQ+ individuals. While Deville’s gender identity has not been a subject of public discussion or speculation, she has always presented herself as a woman.</p><p>Also read: <a href=# rel=bookmark>Adam Silver Kids: Has Two Daughter With His Wife Maggie Grise, Family And Net Worth</a></p><p>Likewise, there is no evidence to suggest that she identifies as anything other than female. It is important to note that Deville’s gender and sexuality are just one aspect of her identity and do not define her as a person or as a wrestler.</p><p>She has achieved success in the wrestling industry based on her talent, hard work, and dedication to her craft. Her identity as a lesbian is a personal aspect of who she is, and it does not diminish her accomplishments or abilities in any way.</p><h2>Sonya Deville Arrest And Charge</h2><p>On March 1st, 2023, Sonya was taken into custody in Borgata due to her possession of a firearm.</p><p>Also Read: <a href=#>Rachel Fuda Nose Job: Jennifer Aydin Mocked Her For Terrible Nose Job</a></p><p><span style=font-family:var(--global-body-font-family)>In August 2020, Sonya Deville made headlines when she and a friend, Mandy Rose, were involved in a frightening incident at Deville’s home in Florida. A man named Phillip A. Thomas II had been stalking Deville for months.</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/tvshowstars.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Sonya-Deville-2.jpg><p>He then broke into her home with a knife and pepper spray in an attempt to kidnap her. Deville and Rose were able to escape the house and call for help, and Thomas was eventually apprehended by the police.</p><p>He was charged with attempted armed kidnapping, armed burglary, and aggravated stalking. While Deville and Rose were able to escape unharmed, the incident understandably left a lasting impact on both of them.</p><p>Deville took time off from wrestling to focus on her well-being and process the experience’s trauma. In November 2020, it was reported that Deville had filed a lawsuit against Thomas.</p><p>According to her, he had caused her emotional distress and violated her privacy by leaking private photos and videos that he had obtained from her home. The lawsuit is still ongoing, and Deville has not spoken publicly about the incident in great detail.</p><p>The incident also had legal consequences for Deville herself. In January 2021, she was charged with two misdemeanor counts of simple battery after allegedly getting into a physical altercation with Rose at the WWE Performance Center in 2019.</p><p>According to reports, the altercation occurred after Deville made a comment about Rose’s appearance, and Rose responded by throwing a towel at her. Deville allegedly grabbed Rose by the hair and pulled her to the ground.</p><p>Deville was not arrested at the time of the incident, but the charges were filed after Rose requested a restraining order against her. Deville pleaded not guilty to the charges, and the case is still ongoing.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmispqi1sMPSrZirq16YvK570qilspldmbK3tculnGaklaivqq3NZp6eppSav26tzZ1krJ2oqq6ttdOyZJqqoprAtXnAp5tmm5iWv6ixjg%3D%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./are-maddie-ziegler-and-jojo-siwa-friends-2.html>&#171;&nbsp;Are Maddie Ziegler and Jojo Siwa friends?
