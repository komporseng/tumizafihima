Radio certainly laid the foundation for my comfort on television. Radio has become an extension of me. I’ve always wanted to do both radio and TV.”</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">The star said he’s always had a passion for radio, ever since he was young. <span class=credit>NBCUniversal via Getty Images</span></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading>More gameshows, 1997</h2><p>In 1997, Seacrest hosted the short-lived Y2K-friendly game show <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">“Click,”</a> which ran for two seasons.</p><p>Teenagers answered questions about the internet as they competed for a cash prize.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">He hosted a gameshow in 1997 called “Click,” which was geared toward teens. <span class=credit>WireImage</span></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading>‘American Idol,’ 2002</h2><p>Seacrest truly became a household name in 2002, when he was tasked with co-hosting the now-hit singing competition show “American Idol.”</p><p>For the show’s first season, he co-hosted with comedian Brian Dunkleman, as singers auditioned for a group of judges — at the time, it was music exec Simon Cowell, singer and choreographer Paula Abdul, and record producer Randy Jackson.

I would love to audition to be the host.’ And so I auditioned eventually to be the host. And I got the job. So I’m happy to still have the job.”</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">He had a co-host, comedian Brian Dunkleman, during the first season, but later became its sole host. <span class=credit>Getty Images</span></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Seacrest’s big break in radio, 2004</h2><p>In 2004, he launched his syndicated radio show “On Air With Ryan Seacrest,” which is another gig he still has going today, as well as “American Top 40.”</p><p>In fact, Seacrest re-upped his deal with iHeartMedia in September 2021, signing a contract that will keep him on the air until 2025, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Variety reported.</a></p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">He signed a big radio deal in 2004. <span class=credit>Getty Images for Macy's</span></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading>‘New Year’s Rockin’ Eve’ special , 2005</h2><p>In 2005, he expanded his hosting resume by<a href=#> joining legend Dick Clark </a>on New Year’s Eve for his “New Year’s Rockin’ Eve” special, ringing in the holiday with performances, jokes, and more.</p><p>The two continued to host together until Clark passed the baton to Seacrest in 2012, something that meant a lot to Seacrest, as he grew up watching the program on TV.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">He and Dick Clark hosted alongside each other from 2005 to 2012, when Clark handed off the baton to Seacrest. <span class=credit>Theo Wargo/DCNYRE2010</span></figure><p>“I’m so grateful that I stepped into this role because it was a tradition for me growing up and my family,” he shared during a 2022 interview with<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"> Entertainment Weekly</a>. “We would order pizza and watch the show. I think the idea for us is just to create a big party for people who don’t want to go anywhere, who want to just relax, be in their homes, be with their families, order pizza, order buffalo wings, whatever it is.”</p><p>He continued, “We can bring the excitement, the energy and the new year to them. That’s what Dick told me all along.
