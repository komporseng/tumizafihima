She has been open about her desire to lose weight. Katie revealed her <strong>20 pounds</strong> weight loss during the Vanderpump Rules season 8 reunion in May 2020. Katie Maloney of Vanderpump Rules was the victim of cruel body shaming in the past after she gained some weight, but she's slimmed down significantly now.</p><p>The American actress discussed her desire to lose weight. After failing to lose weight on several diets, Katie saw a nutritionist, who showed her what foods she should and shouldn't be eating. Her nutritionist told her that she was insulin-resistant or insulin-sensitive and that she needed to eat differently because of her metabolism.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_second_paragraph"></span><p>Maloney stated that she feels good and confident about her eating habits. She now just has a great understanding of nutrition and what kinds of food she should and shouldn't be eating.</p><p>Katie Maloney, 35, thought she had a thyroid condition, which she didn't, but she's glad she started looking after herself because her glucose levels were pretty high, which could've led to some possibly pre-diabetic problems.
