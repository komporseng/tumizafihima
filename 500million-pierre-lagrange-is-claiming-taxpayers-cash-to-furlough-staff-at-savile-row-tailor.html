inspired Matthew Vaughn’s blockbuster Kingsman spy movies.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>But former hedge fund boss LaGrange, famous for his colourful love life, and whose estimated worth is around

risen here dramatically in a way that has killed the economy.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘Britain was the most competitive place in Europe in attracting talent.
